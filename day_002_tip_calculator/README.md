# Day-002: Tip Caclulator

## Overview
This is a simple Python tip calculator that allows users to input the total bill amount, tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill. The program then calculates the amount each person should pay.

## Environment
Python Version: 3.8.15
Operating System: MacOS (14.2.1（23C71）)

## How to use
Run the script in the terminal: ```python /main.py```

## Demo
Below is an example interaction with the program:

```sh
# Input:
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? ${150}
How much tip would you like to give? (%) {12}
How many people to split the bill? {5}
# Output:
Each person should pay: $33.60
```
Note: The values wrapped in **curely brackets** indicate user input
## Lessons Learned
Through this project, I learned something I've never know before:

1. The importance of converting user input into the appropriate data type (float or int).

2. Python allows using _ to separate large numbers for better readability, e.g., 1_000_000 represents 1000000.

Although this project is simple, it reinforced my understanding of variable naming, data handling, and input/output formatting in Python. It also boosted my confidence in developing more complex applications!
